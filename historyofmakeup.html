            <div align="center" class="A1"><h1>HISTORY OF MAKE-UP</h1></div>
            <div align="justify" class="A2"><big> From the copper and lead ore that the ancient Egyptians used to create the world's first cosmetics to the scientifically advanced products of today that can do everything from hide pores, smooth complexions, and turn the pale green of your eyes a vivid shade of emerald, makeup has been an integral part of humankind for thousands of years. Over the centuries, women used burnt matches to darken their eyes, berries to stain their lips and young boys' urine to fade their freckles. They even swallowed ox blood in some misguided attempt to improve their complexions.</big></div>
            <div align="justify" class="A3"><big> Women throughout history put their health at risk with many of their homemade cosmetics. In some cultures, for example, women used arsenic, lead, mercury, and even leeches to give themselves the pale appearance deemed beautiful in the old days. Thankfully, we've come a long way from the days of using toxic and deadly mixtures to enhance our looks.</big></div>
            <div align="justify" class="A4"><big>Today's multibillion dollar cosmetic industry must meet strict government regulations about what it can and cannot include in products and must follow safe manufacturing guidelines. Today, the most serious injury you're likely to receive from your cosmetics is an irritation from a product that is too harsh for your skin, or an allergic rash from a fragrance or a preservative in the product. Yet, despite decades of safety testing and a safety record unparalleled in many industries, there are many myths circulating about the dangers of cosmetic ingredients.</big></div>

            <div align="center" class="A6"><h1>5</h1></div>
            <div align="center" class="A7"><h2>Eye dilation was considered beautiful<h2></div>
            <div align="center" class="A8"><img src="https://static2.thetalkoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/dialated-pupil.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=738" width="500" height="420"></div>
            <div align="justify" class="A9"><big>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. She’s the apple of his eye. She’s an eye-full. Eyes are the window to the soul. Expressions that use eyes show us how important the eye is in culture and beauty. We gaze into each other’s eyes, even. We get lost in each other’s eyes. Our fascination just doesn’t quit, does it? While the eyes have been the center attraction in terms of women's beauty, they were also at risk during the last 18th century when Italian women were thought to be more attractive depending on the size of their pupils. In order to achieve this look, women applied the dangerous bella donna plant. However, and unfortunately, the flower and the berries are poisonous and were known to cause blindness or mental weakness; and in some cases even death. If you want that look today, all you’ve got to do it buy a pair of specialized contact lenses.</big></div>

            <div align="center" class="A12"><img src="https://static2.thetalkoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Instagram-556339.png?q=50&fit=crop&w=738" width="350" height="450"></div>
            <div align="justify" class="A13"><big>It seems so easy, right. I mean, just hold up the back of your hand to the colors and voila, you have got your match. That is what we were taught, right? Well, girls, we were taught wrong. First, you have to know your skin type (dry, oily, combination, or sensitive), then you have to know your tone (warm, cool, or neutral). Only from there can you find the best foundation to suit your skin. Also, apply the sample to your jawline as that will give you the best indicator as to whether the color you’ve selected will match best with your undertones. Then, before you think about buying, check out the foundation in a natural light because foundation should not be seen, but is rather the canvas upon which we play. To find the right shade of concealer, use the skin on the inside of the arm. And to give a very natural look that’s also light and airy, mix foundation with facial moisturizer.</big></div>

            <div align="center" class="A15"><h2>All that glitters is not gold</h2></div>
            <div align="center" class="A16"><img src="https://static3.thetalkoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/fish-glitter.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=738"></div>
            <div align="justify" class="A17"><big>Glitter is not for every occasion, although it could and should be; well, it depends on who you talk to, that is. With bubblegum goth and the 90s all over the place, glitter is having a real hay day among beauty aficionados everywhere. If it’s not glitter eyeshadow, it’s glittery blush or lip gloss. But not all that glitters is gold. Sorry, girls, but the stuff that makes you sparkle to the nines and shine until midnight is not magic fairy dust. Some of it is made from fish scales. And you might say, Oh, mermaids! That’s close enough because mermaids are half fish. So if you’re into the environment or animals or mythical creatures from beyond, you might want to reconsider that glitter blend and say goodbye to a trend that will, eventually, die out, like a fish out of water.</big></div>
            <div align="center" class="A18"><h1>2</h1></div>
            <div align="center" class="A19"><h2>Don't worry if you're pale</h2></div>
            <div align="center" class="A20"><img src="https://static0.thetalkoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/pale-skin.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=738" width="400" height="300"></div>
            <div align="justify" class="A21"><big>Tanned skin is something really new to our modern culture. Coco Chanel, in the early 20th century, brought light to sunbathing as a new form of beauty when she publicly tanned herself. However, before her bold sun worship, women favored fairness. And truth be told, many cultures still practice this antiquated way of looking at skin and beauty; although not in a mutually exclusive way. In Egypt, women used chalk power and lead to make a paste for their faces. During Medieval time blood letting flushed women’s complexions and gave them that extra paleness they sought. Queen Elizabeth used white lead paint to give her the mask of youth that became a very popular fashion trend. For centuries, tanned skin was for the working class. However, we all need to see the beauty in the skin that we were born in; that old European standard of beauty is junk, straight up. We are all goddesses, period.</big></div>
            <div align="center" class="A22"><h1>1</h1></div>
            <div align="center" class="A23"><h2>Choose your mascara with care</h2></div>
            <div align="center" class="A24"><img src="https://static3.thetalkoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/mascara.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=738" width="400" height="300"></div>
            <div align="justify" class="A25"><big>Before the 19th century there was no mascara. Can you believe that? Like really hard to believe, right? Mascara is what gives our face that completed look. And with fake lashes, we can really imitate a full lash look without much trouble at all. In the 1400s women removed their eyelashes, along with their eyebrows and hair, because it was aesthetically pleasing. You can imagine no mascara, but no hair –like completely hairless? So since mascara is fairly new to modern women, the formula hasn’t been exactly friendly. Back in the day, waterproof mascara used turpentine. It has not been confirmed if it remains to be one of the ingredients of today’s waterproof mascaras, but don’t take the risk. Better to have mascara running down your face than eyes that have been burned by chemicals. Investigate what you put in and near your eyes; after all, you’ve only got one set of eyes, doll face.</big></div>
